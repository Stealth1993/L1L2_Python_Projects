# This code generates a Hubble diagram showing the relationship between the distance of galaxies and their recession velocity.
# The plot includes a line representing the Hubble constant, illustrating the linear relationship expected in an expanding universe.
# The data is simulated, with some random noise added to the velocities to mimic real observational data.
# The plot is displayed using matplotlib, with labeled axes and a legend for clarity.
# The code is designed to be run in a Python environment with the necessary libraries installed.
# The code is a simple implementation of a Hubble diagram plot using matplotlib.
