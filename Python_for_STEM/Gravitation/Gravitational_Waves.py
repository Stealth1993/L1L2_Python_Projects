# This code simulates the gravitational wave strain from a binary black hole merger and plots the waveform.
# The parameters can be adjusted to simulate different scenarios.
# Note: The strain function is a simplified model and does not represent the full complexity of gravitational waveforms.
# The code uses Astropy for units and constants, and Matplotlib for plotting.
# The waveform generated is a basic representation and does not include all the complexities of real gravitational wave signals.

# The code is designed to be run in a Python environment with the necessary libraries installed.
# Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
# pip install numpy matplotlib astropy
# The code is a simplified model and does not include all the complexities of real gravitational wave signals.

# Application:
# This code can be used in astrophysics research to simulate and visualize gravitational wave signals from binary black hole mergers.
