#BFS: (Breadth-First Search) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.

This program visualizes the BFS algorithm as it solves a maze. The maze is represented as a grid, where:
- # denotes walls,

- <space> denotes open paths,

- O is the starting point, and

X is the endpoint.

The program uses the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the start to the end of the maze. It visually displays the maze and highlights the path being explored. The program allows users to interactively step through each iteration of the algorithm by pressing a key.
